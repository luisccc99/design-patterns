# Design Patterns

## What are design patterns?
While developing software the only constant that we are gonna face is **change** and this is not something new, people from the 70s, 80s, and so on, experienced this as well, the problem comes when we are working on these systems and we're trying to add new features, refactor some parts or understand how everything works, to make a long story short this can become a real nightmare, and the key to avoid this, is to anticipate what varies or changes in a system and encapsulate it, bassicaly *designing for change*.

Turs out in the mid 90s, a group of four people: Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Raph Johnson, and John Vlissides (later known as the "Gang of Four" or "GoF") published a book named "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" where they grouped a set of solutions to problems they had came up against
