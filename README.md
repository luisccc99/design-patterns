## What are design patterns?
While developing software the only constant we're gonna face is **change** and this is not something new, people from the 70s, 80s, and so on, experienced this as well, the problem comes when we are working on systems that are not prepared for this, because we're gonna try to work with code that is not flexible meaning there'll be a point in which we won't able to add new features or even fix bugs. The key to avoiding all this is to anticipate what varies or changes in a system and encapsulate it basically *designing for change*.

Turns out in the mid 90s, a group of four people: Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Raph Johnson, and John Vlissides (later known as the "Gang of Four" or "GoF") published a book named "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" where they grouped a set of solutions to problems they had came up against

## Why should you learn this?
- **Shared vocabulary.** Say what you think with less words.  
- **Solution to common problems.** Design patterns are tested solutions to common problems.

## What type of patterns exist?  
From [Classification of patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/classification).  
- **Creational.** Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.  
- **Structural.** Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.  
- **Behavioral.** Take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsabilities between objects.
